# ProMan
ProMan is a project manager for C/C++, written in C (ironic, right?).

# Installing
Installing is really easy, just:
```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/aa2006/proman
# Go into the repo
cd proman
# Build and install
make all
```
Now run `proman version`. It should output the version if everything went correctly.
